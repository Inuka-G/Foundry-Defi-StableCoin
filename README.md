# DeFi Stablecoin Project

This is a decentralized, algorithmic stablecoin designed to maintain a relative peg to USD. The protocol is built with exogenous collateralization using assets like wETH and wBTC, and it leverages Foundry for development, testing, and deployment.

## Key Features

- **Relative Stability**: Maintains a peg to USD.
- **Algorithmic Stability Mechanism**: Decentralized algorithms ensure the stability of the stablecoin.
- **Exogenous Collateralization**: Backed by external assets such as:
  - wETH (Wrapped Ether)
  - wBTC (Wrapped Bitcoin)
